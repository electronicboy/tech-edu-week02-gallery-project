# Tech Educators Week 2 assignment

I created a website which uses media queries to provide some level of control over how
the contents of the page looks across desktop and mobile experiences.
I ensured that alt tags were set on content in order to ensure that information is presented to users
using screen readers. I ensured that the gallery index is accessible to users using screen readers.

I believe that I met all of the requirements for the project, I feel somewhat discontented with the media
queries and their lack of usage and may expend upon this as I toy with the stretch goals.

utilsing CSS to get the desired outcome is somewhat difficult at times due to a bit of a lack of experience/creativity
when it comes to taking advantage of them to pull off desired effects, for example, not realizing that having set the
justify-content on the flex was causing my images to be clipped under the thumbnail container div.
